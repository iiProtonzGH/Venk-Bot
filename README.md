# Venk Bot

Hello! I'm Venk Bot, a multi-purpose Discord bot written in JavaScript created by [VenkSociety](http://github.com/VenkSociety). I'm equipped with lots of features and commands as well as custom configuration to suit your personal preferences.

## Configuration

Configuration is as easy as editing a single file. No coding knowledge needed!

    {
    "prefix": "/", 
    "token": "YOUR-BOT-TOKEN",
    "welcome_msg": "general",
    "default_role": "member"
    }
    
In order for the bot to work, you'll need to gather your bot's token and replace "YOUR-BOT-TOKEN" with your bot's token.

To change the prefix for commands, simply replace "/" with whatever your preferred prefix is. E.g. ;help would result in ";".

By default, the channel where the bot will post welcome messages is "general". Simply replace "general" with the channel you'd like the messages to be sent to.

The role that is given to a member upon joining is "member" by default. Change it to whatever role you want. If you don't want any, just leave it as "member", or if you already have a member role, change it to a non-vacant role.
